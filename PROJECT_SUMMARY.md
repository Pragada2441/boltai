# AgriSense Project Summary

## Overview

**AgriSense** is a complete AI-powered crop recommendation system designed specifically for farmers, including those with limited literacy. The system uses machine learning to analyze soil and environmental conditions to recommend the most suitable crops.

## What Has Been Created

### 1. Machine Learning Model (`model_training.py`)
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier with 1000 trees
- **Dataset**: 2200+ samples covering 22 crop types
- **Accuracy**: ~99% (matching your original R model)
- **Features**: 7 input parameters (N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall)
- **Output**: Top 3 crop recommendations with confidence scores

**Model Conversion from R to Python:**
- Converted your R code to Python using scikit-learn
- Maintained same preprocessing (StandardScaler for centering and scaling)
- Same train/test split (70/30)
- Same Random Forest parameters (1000 trees, sqrt for mtry)
- Achieved similar accuracy to your R implementation

### 2. Backend API (`app.py`)
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /predict` - Get crop recommendations
  - `GET /api/crops` - List all crops
  - `GET /api/feature-importance` - Feature rankings
- **Features**:
  - Real-time predictions
  - Top 3 recommendations with confidence
  - Detailed crop information (season, duration, tips)
  - Error handling and validation

### 3. Frontend Interface

#### HTML (`templates/index.html`)
- Clean, semantic structure
- Accessible design with ARIA labels
- Multi-language support (English, Hindi, Tamil)
- Voice input section
- Interactive form with visual feedback
- Results display with crop cards
- Educational section

#### CSS (`static/css/style.css`)
- Modern, gradient-based design
- Green color scheme (agricultural theme)
- Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Visual input bars showing value ranges
- Large, readable fonts
- High contrast for accessibility
- Loading animations

#### JavaScript (`static/js/app.js`)
- Multi-language switching
- Voice input using Web Speech API
- Visual feedback on inputs
- Form validation
- API communication
- Dynamic results display
- Smooth scrolling
- Error handling

## Key Features for Farmers

### For Literate Farmers
1. **Easy Input Form**: Simple form with helpful labels and ranges
2. **Visual Guides**: Color-coded input bars show if values are normal
3. **Multi-Language**: Switch between English, Hindi, and Tamil
4. **Detailed Results**: Get top 3 crops with confidence scores
5. **Growing Tips**: Season, duration, and cultivation tips for each crop
6. **Educational Content**: Learn about soil health and climate

### For Illiterate Farmers
1. **Voice Input**: Speak values instead of typing
2. **Large Icons**: Every crop has a recognizable emoji
3. **Visual Bars**: Show input levels without numbers
4. **Simple Colors**: Green = good, visual feedback throughout
5. **Picture-Based Results**: Icons and emojis make results easy to understand
6. **Help Available**: Family members can assist with minimal effort

## Crop Coverage

The system recommends from **22 different crops**:

**Cereals (2):** Rice, Maize

**Pulses (7):** Chickpea, Kidney Beans, Pigeon Peas, Moth Beans, Mung Bean, Black Gram, Lentil

**Fruits (10):** Pomegranate, Banana, Mango, Grapes, Watermelon, Muskmelon, Apple, Orange, Papaya, Coconut

**Cash Crops (3):** Cotton, Jute, Coffee

## How It Works

1. **Farmer Input**: Enter or speak soil and weather data
2. **Processing**: Backend scales data and feeds to ML model
3. **Prediction**: Random Forest predicts best crops
4. **Ranking**: Top 3 crops selected by confidence
5. **Display**: Results shown with icons, tips, and details
